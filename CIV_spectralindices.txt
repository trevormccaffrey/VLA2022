I'm curious how spectral indices change throughout the CIV space.  Namely because, since we suggest that the CIV space (at least roughly) tracks changing radio origins, there should be corresponding a spectral index gradient throughout CIV.

For now, all I care about are detections.

To start, I'll just trace spectral indices from 1.4-3 GHz.
1) Match Amy Rankine's CIV catalog to FIRST
2) Match (1) to the new preliminary VLASS source catalog.
